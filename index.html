					<p>We are Team Legends and here we are doing our tryouts for the Engineering Academy where we get to experience
					what it feels like to be students in Singapore Polytechnic's finest engineering programme, we are doing a project where we work 
					on an automated paper plane launcher which we designed in just three days!<br><br>
					We also get to do other fun projects included in the package
					as we learn and document our experience throughout the three days on this website. Please do enjoy and check out the blog listed on our
					navigation!<br><br>
